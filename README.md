# JavaScript 20: Picture-In-Picture

This project was created as part of the Udemy course [JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume) by Andrei Neagoie and Jacinto Wong.

## Live application

This project can be viewed live at: 
https://mattlayton1986.github.io/js20-picture-in-picture/

## Running the app locally

1. Make sure to have a server that can serve static HTML projects. I use the [LiveServer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for VS Code.

2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mattlayton1986/js20-picture-in-picture.git
```

3. Run the project via the aforementioned server. For VSCode Live Server, just click the "Go Live" option at the very bottom of the editor window and Live Server will launch the site for you.

## Using the App

This project is an experiment with the Screen Capture and Picture-In-Picture Web APIs. 

To use the app, open a separate tab/browser window and load up a video of any kind (for example, a [Youtube video of a burning fireplace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt4Z2AA5Kj0)).

Refresh this application, then click "Start". Select the window with the running video and a separate picture-in-picture window will pop up with a feed of the video.

This separate window will stay on top of other windows and can be freely moved and resized.

## Contributions

Because this is a Udemy-based personal project (and a fairly simple one at that), I am not accepting Pull Requests or submissions for new features at this time.
